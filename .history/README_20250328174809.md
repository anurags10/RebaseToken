# Cross-Chain-Rebase Token

1. A protocol that allow user to deposit into the vault and in return, receive a rebase tokens that represent their underlying balance.
2. Rebase token -> balanceOf function is dynamic to show changing balance with time.
   - Balance increases linearly over the time.
   - Mint a token to the users everytime they perform an actions(minting, burning,transferring,bridigng etc.)
3. Interest Rate
   - Individually set an interest rate for each user based on some global interest rate of the protocol at the time the user deposits into the vault.
   - This global interest rate can only decrease to incentivise/reward early adopters.
   - Increase token adoption
